/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written
/// T0 <: T1) when:
/// A record type A is a subtype of record type B iff they have same shape and
/// the types of all fields of A are subtypes of the corresponding field types
/// of B
/// 
/// @description Check that if type T0 is a record with the same shape that T1
/// and the types of all fields of T0 is subtype of of the corresponding field
/// types of T1 then T0 is subtype of T1. Check named fields only
