/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1
/// (written T0 <: T1) when:
/// ...
/// Interface Compositionality: `T0` is an interface type `C0<S0, ..., Sk>` and
/// `T1` is `C0<U0, ..., Uk>`. For `i` in `0..k`, let `vi` be the declared
/// variance of the `i`th type parameter of `C0`. Then, for each `i` in `0..k`,
/// one of the following holds:
///  - `Si <: Ui` and `vi` is absent or `out`.
///  - `Ui <: Si` and `vi` is `in`.
///  - `Si <: Ui` and `Ui <: Si`, and `vi` is `inout`.
///
/// @description Check that if type `T0` is an interface type `C0<S0, ..., Sk>`
/// and `T1` is `C0<U0, ..., Uk>` and there is `Sj` which is not a subtype of
/// `Uj` then `T0` is not a subtype of `T1`
